# Proofs and Programs 🚧 🏗️Under Construction 👷 🚧

This repository hourses course materials for learning Logic, lambda calculus, and Lean. Including slides, lecture notes, and exercises. 

## Course Overview

### Logic 🏛️
- Propositional Logic: Basic grammar of logical connectives and natural deduction.
- First-Order Logic: Introduction to quantifiers, predicates, and more natural deductions.

### λ-Calculus 🧮 
- Un-typed Lambda Calculus: Write programs in Alonso Church's lambda calculus. 
- Simply Typed Lambda Calculus: Adding typed structure to the lambda calculus. Write typing derivations to ensure programs are well-typed.
- Dependent Type Theory: Learn how simple type theory is extended to allow for a much more expressive language. 

### Lean 👨‍💻
- Lean Theorem Prover: Instructions on how to get started with Lean, a proof assistant.
- Interactive Proofs: Writing and verifying proofs using Lean's type theory.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    You can make a local copy of the repository by cloning it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/proofgrams.git
   cd proofgrams
   ```
    Or simply downloading the repository. 

2. **Course Materials** 📚 (Incomplete drafts)

    - [Lecture Slides](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/proofgrams/tree/main/slides): These are skeletal slides, to be filled during class. 
    - [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/proofgrams/tree/main/notes): Detailed notes on logic, lambda calculus, and Lean.
    - [Tutorials](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/proofgrams/tree/main/tutorials): Practice problems to test your understanding.
    - Projects: Larger assignments to apply your knowledge.

3. **Getting Started with Lean:**

To get a feel for how working in Lean, both of the introductory games [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/) and [A Lean Introduction to Logic](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/trequetrum/lean4game-logic) are particularly relevant to this course. You can follow this [Quickstart Guide](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html) to begin working with Lean on your personal computer.
