# Logic, Lambda Calculus, and Lean

Welcome to the course materials for learning Logic, Lambda Calculus, and Lean. This repository contains resources for students, educators, and anyone interested in these topics.

## Course Overview

### Logic
- **Propositional Logic**: Basic grammar of logical connectives and natural deduction.
- **First-Order Logic**: Introduction to quantifiers, predicates, and more natural deductions.

### Lambda Calculus
- **Un-typed Lambda Calculus**: 
- **Simply Typed Lambda Calculus**: Adding typed structure to the lambda calculus and typing derivations.
- **Dependent Type Theory**: At this point we jump over to Lean.

### Lean
- **Lean Theorem Prover**: Hands-on experience with Lean, a proof assistant.
- **Interactive Proofs**: Writing and verifying proofs using Lean's type theory.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

    Install Lean:
    Follow the instructions on the Lean community website to install Lean and its dependencies.
    Open the Project:
    Open the project in your preferred editor. VSCode with the Lean extension is recommended.

2. **Course Materials**

    Lecture Notes: Detailed notes on logic, lambda calculus, and Lean.
    Tutorials: Practice problems to test your understanding.
    Projects: Larger assignments to apply your knowledge.
