% Constructivism in Mathematics by Troelstra and van Dalen 
% Comes in two volumes. 

% Chapter 2 page 40 has rules of inference. 
% Chapter 2 page 47 has mention of "deductions from axioms". 
% Chapter 2 page 48 treats identity = as "mathematical" 
% Intuitionistic logic is referred to as IPC/IQC in its 
% propositional resp. first order variants. 
% Chapter 2 has interesting notes on Intuitionistic First Order 
% Arithmetic aka Heyting Arithmetic (HA)
% Volume 2 has chapters on Type Theory and Model Theory. 
% Model theory of Lattices and ** Heyting Algebras ** is the 
%   type I am interested in. 
% There are also notes on Categorial semantics. Sites etc.

% Has same proof of completeness and soundess as van Dalen.
